# pi-security

This is a home security system built using a raspberry pi and a usb camera.

This project uses OpenCV to detect motion and record video footage when it is detected. The video is then stored localy in the directory and accessed thru the video manager. It will then notify the user(s) thru an SMS

Thru the video manager you can:
- view security footage
- delete security footage
- view camera for positioning
